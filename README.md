These are my version of the legendary [Holman .dotfiles](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/). I use the Visual Studio Code as my main editor and I've been playing around with trying to install fonts as part of the install. 

Other than that it is pretty much the same as the [original repo](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles).
